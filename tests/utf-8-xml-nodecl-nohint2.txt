<title>Surgeon - at Blackest Ever Black</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//1771/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1771/</guid>
<description>Surgeon remains one of electronic music's most consistently thrilling performers. Hugely influential in techno circles since the mid nineties, his productions and DJ mixes point to constant evolution in his sound and a steady absorption of new influences.

Last year's Breaking the Frame, his first album in over ten years, struck a curveball at all those anticipating a pummelling set of textured techno tracks, instead distilling some of his listening habits of recent years &amp;mdash; the likes of Alice Coltrane, Eliane Radigue and La Monte Young &amp;mdash; into a very personal document, one that searched for, as he put it, 'the deep spiritual essence that lay behind the surface structures of their individual music'.

This set was recorded in October 2011 in London, when Surgeon performed as the mystery guest at a showcase night for the Blackest Ever Black label. Given Blackest Ever&amp;#8217;s brooding trajectory, the event&amp;#8217;s line-up struck a suitably shadowy tone, featuring label mainstays Raime, William Bennett's formidable Cut Hands project, and long-time Surgeon collaborator  Regis (with whom Surgeon performed a surprise closing set under their British Murder Boys guise).

As Surgeon himself said, there was a rather strange, tense atmosphere in the club throughout the evening, due no doubt to hosting a bill of such intensely disturbed music in the heart of London's hip Shoreditch, and this tension probably comes across on this recording from the night.

This is the last set to be hosted on Spannered for the foreseeable future. Many thanks to Tony for passing the recording to us and for giving his support to the site since day one.

<title>agent2 - Le Orme</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//1743/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1743/</guid>
<description>We've been trying to squeeze a mix from Lawrence (aka agent2) of London's Rebel Intelligence collective for some time now. Le Orme (meaning footprints) rocks out the kind of lush electronic tackle you'd expect from this exceptional connoisseur of early Chicago house, Detroit techno and deep dancefloor electro. If you've ever caught one of Lawrence's flawlessly programmed DJ sets, you'll be all over this.

The fledgling Rebel Intelligence label has a couple of great electro 12&amp;quot;s out by Matt Whitehead. Snap them up if you haven't already.
&amp;nbsp;
Tracklisting:


    Submersible Machines - Blue Hole
    Steve Summers - Dreaming in Color
    DJ Sprinkles (Kink &amp;amp; Neville Watson Remix) - Masturjakor
    Perseus Traxx - Remake 508
    Murphy Jax Featuring Mike Dunn - It&amp;#8217;s the Music
    Steve Summers - Lucid Fingers
    Kink &amp;amp; Neville Watson - The Long Wait
    Elec Pt.1 - Sky 13
    Risque Rythum Team - 122 House
    Kink &amp;amp; Neville Watson - City 2 City
    Virgo Four - In a Vision
    Snuff Crew - Slam it
    Surburban Knight - The Groove
    Conforce - Black Stroke

<title>Bass Clef - Inner Space Influences</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//1741/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1741/</guid>
<description>Ralph Cumbers describes his latest release as &amp;quot;an open love letter to underground dance music culture&amp;quot;. Out earlier this month on Magic and Dreams, Inner Space Break Free harks back to ye olde days of hardcore and rave, with influences not so much worn on its sleeve as emblazoned across the back of a friggin' great fluoro jacket.

The album is available on cassette only (&amp;quot;I&amp;#8217;m releasing it on tape because I adore them, and all my music is made on a cassette 4-track, so it feels kind of right&amp;quot;), and is dedicated to &amp;quot;the tunes, DJs, soundsystems, noisy neighbours and pirate stations that have inspired me and repeatedly turned my head inside out over the last two decades&amp;quot;, says Cumbers. Rave on, we say.
&amp;nbsp;
'Inner Space Influences' mixes up many of the classic dance tracks that influenced Inner Space. If you've not checked out Mr Clef's other mixes on Spannered, we recommend you seek out his excellent dub mixes here and here, and last year's tremendous African mix here. You can also read Spannered's interview with him from 2006.

<description>Meticulously assembled then recorded down onto cassette, London producer Matt Whitehead reworks and splices together his two 30-minute sets from this year's Bloc Weekend (one performance being at Brackout, the tribute to the much-missed Ben Bracket that kickstarted the festval).

Along with material released collaboratively as Cyantific and Signal Type, Matt has two essential electro 12&amp;quot;s out under his own name for London's Rebel Intelligence collective.

Along with material released collaboratively as Cyantific and Signal Type, Matt has two essential electro 12&amp;quot;s out under his own name for London's Rebel Intelligence collective.
&amp;nbsp;
Like his set from 2010's Bloc Weekend, this is the real deal.
&amp;nbsp;
Play it loud.

<link>http://www.spannered.org//1678/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1678/</guid>
<description>Those who have listened to the latest album by Ralph Cumbers will know something of his huge love for the rhythms of Africa. Earlier this year Ralph ripped and re-edited a number of his favourite vinyls from the motherland. The resulting mix &amp;mdash; released as part of Fact Magazine's consistently excellent podcast series &amp;mdash; is the most colourful and crazed selection of music we've heard so far this year. If you missed it (Fact's podcasts are available for three weeks only), don't fear as Ralph recently asked Spannered to give the mix a permanent home.
&amp;nbsp;
Mr Clef talks about the mix, his current African obsessions and the recent album in an interview over at the Fact site. Those new to his work may also want to check Spannered's interview with him back in 2006.
&amp;nbsp;
Tracklisting:


    Segun Adewale - Yo Pop Music
    Susan Mapfumo - Dzvoko
    Zani Diabete - Super Djata
    Fede Lawu - Cherie Coco

<title>Kid Kameleon - Extremely Small and Precise Sounds #1</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//1676/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1676/</guid>
<description>Back in 2007, Kid Kameleon dropped an excellent pair of mixes for Spannered and Mashit exploring, as he put it, 'the weirder end of the dubstep spectrum'.
&amp;nbsp;
Well, Matt's racked up another double-drop of current picks from the bass music panoramic, with the first installment landing here on Spannered and part two surfacing over at the Mashit camp. As with Aim High/Aim Low, the Kid eschews clubland's big hitters in favour of the fringe elements, packing out both new mixes with some super-deep dubstep/techno hybrids and plenty of mutant 2-step stylings.
&amp;nbsp;
Tracklisting:


    Invasion Vs Shackleton - Wizards In Dub Part 1
    Martyn - Is This Insanity ft Spaceape (Ben Klock mix)
    Teleseen - Black Monday feat. Jah Sight
    Hizatron - Telescope Dope
    Deadboy - Brock Lee Riddim
    xxxy - Blue Flashing Lights
    Instra:mental - Forbidden
    Al Tourettes - Dodgem
    Planetary Assualt Systems - X Speaks To X (Al Tourettes &amp;amp; Appleblim remix)
    Millie &amp;amp; Andrea - Black Hammer
    Kontext - Convex Curved Mirror
    Sigha - Hold Your Heart Up To The Light
    Wedge &amp;amp; Aesoteric - Detached Reality
    LV - Kowton Metronome (LV Rmx)
    Untold - Beacon (W/D Franklin)
    Scuba - Poppies (Substance dub version)

<title>Matt Whitehead - Live at Bloc Weekend 2010</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//1669/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1669/</guid>
<description>Another year, another Bloc. Another week-long hangover endured by thousands, as they attempt to piece together the muddled events of four days awake in a holiday camp-cum-ravezone patrolled by terrifyingly beady seagulls.

In the early hours of Saturday morning, all the energy in Minehead Butlins seemed centred in the Jak Bloc venue, where Matt Whitehead played an hour-long live set of razor-tight electro, acid and techno.

One half of drum'n'bass duo Cyantific, Matt's been getting lots of props for his solo material  following the release of his Beat the Heat 12&amp;quot;, put out last year by long-running electro collective Rebel Intelligence. He's also released a series of excellent machinefunk tracks with Sync 24 as Signal Type.

For anyone who was miles from Minehead, or cowering in their chalet &amp;mdash; or for those ready for a flashback&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; here's the recording.</description>

<title>LJ Kruzer - Electronic Picks</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//1664/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1664/</guid>
<description>Anyone following the trajectory of London's open-eared Uncharted Audio label will know of Stephen Fiske's work as LJ Kruzer and his propensity for dispensing wonderfully emotive tracks loaded with intricate melodies and lush sonic textures.
&amp;nbsp;
Son of a Wiltshire vicar, Fiske's formative years were spent listening to his father accompanying hymn singing in church with a Yamaha keyboard &amp;mdash; which goes far in explaining his penchant for perky re-rubs of Christmas carols.
&amp;nbsp;
Since first appearing on vinyl in 2002 (a split EP with The Council Flats of Kingsbury), the London-based producer has released a steady stream of tracks and remixes on Uncharted Audio, AI, Seed and a raft of netlabels. Last year saw the release of his widely lauded second album, Manhood &amp;amp; Electronics, an Eno-inspired masterpiece filled with gorgeous piano treatments, haunting synths and delicate percussive pulses.
&amp;nbsp;
Uncharted Audio's next release sees four tracks from Manhood &amp;amp; Electronics getting remix treatment from TVO, Trademark, Cyan341 and Ukkonen (info and audio here). To mark the occasion, Spannered is pleased to host an exclusive mix of LJ Kruzer's 'electronic picks', freshly gathered up from the interweb and glued together for your enjoyment.
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;quot;The mix is the result of an evening spent digging through online mp3 retailers for nice new electronic music. As someone who doesn't consume music in this format &amp;mdash; I'm only just catching on to the convenience of CDs! &amp;mdash; it was an interesting experience, but not as much fun as going out into the world and hunting and gathering vinyl. The one positive thing about shopping for mp3s online, I suppose, is that it's easier to avoid buying crap music. Not all the tunes on the mix are from mp3 shops &amp;mdash; some of them are recent works made or released by musical friends. Anyway, now I have a folder on the family laptop full of new mp3s and nothing to do with them. Do I have to buy an iPod now? Are they even still called iPods...?&amp;quot;
&amp;nbsp;
LJ Kruzer, February 2010

<description>New York-based multidisciplinary artist Daniel Perlin, aka DJ N-RON, first appeared on Spannered back in 2008 with his excellent Collaborator Mixtape.

The M-C-M1 Mixtape, like its predecessor, comes loaded with Daniel's own productions and mash-ups. This time around a sizzling Latin flavour prevails, with cumbia, reggaeton and baile funk jams bumping up against dark electronica, skewed pop and even the classic cover of Money (That's What I Want) by the Flying Lizards.

<title>Max Duley - Let's Get This Party Slanted</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//1660/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1660/</guid>
<description>Over more than a decade, in his production and DJ work, as well as his emergent photography, West London dweller Duley has continually delighted in bringing us the oblique and unexpected.
&amp;nbsp;
In Let's Get This Party Slanted, a spare and haunting frame wears in turn several digital and analogue guises. Look for lights flashing out from the murky maisma, bits of Autechre, Chris Carter, Sun Electric and others leading towards catharsis in James Plotkin and Mick Harris's well-named Collapse.

<title>Emptyset - DJ mix</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//1645/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1645/</guid>
<description>Emptyset was born in 2005 when James 'Ginz' Ginzburg (30Hz, Joker collaborator, and co-founder of Tectonic Recordings) met art curator and DJ Paul Purgas (the man behind last year's excellent We Can Elude Control release) through Bristol's music scene.
&amp;nbsp;
The duo embarked on a production project to explore their musical commonalities, such as low frequencies, sound design and rhythm. The results &amp;mdash; a nervous-sounding strain of minimal techno, fortified by bone-rattling subbass &amp;mdash; first surfaced in 2007 with a pair of sought-after EPs for Future Days. A third EP appeared on Julian Smith's Caravan Recordings in 2008, paving the way for the label to release Emptyset's eponymously titled debut album last month.
&amp;nbsp;
Clocking in at just over 37 minutes, the album is a buzzing opus of lumbering rhythms, creeping distortion, bleeps, hums and warm bass tones. 'We wanted to create situations where the music came alive from its own side by finding the points within signal chains where distortion begins to form before it overpowers', they explain of the album in an interview over at Sonic Router.
&amp;nbsp;
This mix pulls together some of Emptyset's reference points, from the glitch-ridden electronics of Alva Noto and classic minimalism of Richie Hawtin's Plastikman material to emotive Aphex acid and the advanced techno/dubstep workouts of 2562.
&amp;nbsp;
Emptyset have a stack of projects lined up for 2010, including a series of live techno recordings made in a haunted house (!) &amp;mdash; watch this space...
&amp;nbsp;

Tracklisting:


    Byetone - Plastic Star (Alva Noto remix)
    MLZ - New Analogue Century
    Hauntologists - Hauntologists 2
    Carl Craig &amp;amp; Moritz Von Oswald - Recomposed

<title>Octa Push - live at the Glade Festival 2009</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//1640/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1640/</guid>
<description>Portuguese brothers Leo (Dizzycutter) and Bruno (Mushug) have been working on their respective musical projects for over a decade, but it was only last year when they were asked play a show in their home city of Lisbon for local crew Conspira that they joined forces to form live/production outfit Octo Push. Since then the duo have found themselves increasingly in demand, remixing the likes of Jahcoozi, Buraka Som Sistema and DJ C, gigging from Glade Festival to Fabric, and even catching the ear of Thom Yorke with their highly kinetic blend of garage, techno, IDM, Afrobeat and bashment.
&amp;nbsp;
Octa Push made their vinyl debut this summer, launching Monkey Steak's Steak House imprint by way of a split EP with fellow Lisbon resident Mr Gasparov. This month sees the release of a white-hot three-tracker for Lisbon/Barcelona-based Iberian Records featuring the vocal talents of Cape Verde's Toni Clean and&amp;nbsp;Panamanian-born MC Zulu, as well as the inclusion of their track Quebu Sabe on Soul Jazz Record's Steppa's Delight 2 compilation. They're also due to feature on Fabric's forthcoming release Elevator Music Vol I.

This live set was recorded on the Overkill stage at Glade 2009 as part of a showcase for Bristol's Ruffnek Diskotek (Octa Push appearing alongside Heatwave, Monkey Steak, Ghislain Poirier and MC Zulu, and Tim Dub Boy). Leo and Bruno tell us that their live act will undergo something of a transformation over the coming months, so track them down if they're playing a gig near you and find out what they've got in store.

<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1622/</guid>
<description>This mix includes dense aural fogs and deep soundscapes of clarity from the likes of Mika Vainio, Deathprod, CoH, field recordist Chris Watson, and the majestic Delia Derbyshire. Coldfall is inspired by the now-fragmented ancient woodland of London and its perseverance throughout the centuries.&amp;nbsp;It also owes much to erratic weather patterns deluging London with downpours during the time of its conception.
&amp;nbsp;
Originally broadcast on Ill FM, August 2009.

<title>Transparent Sound - live at Burning Man 2008</title>

<description> 
'Burning Man 2008 saw over 49,000 participants revelling in the Black Rock Desert, working together to create the magic metropolis that is Black Rock City. The week was bookended by vicious dust storms, between which Mother Nature graced our encampment with gorgeously placid weather, allowing participants to enjoy the artwork, community and broad expanses of the playa. The Man, standing atop an obelisk bedecked with the flags of all nations, spoke of our American Dream, which is truly a global dream. Saturday's dust storms broke their stranglehold on the city in time to allow the community to gather to watch the Man burn late that night. On Sunday evening, Shrine and Tuktuk's &amp;quot;Basura Sagrada&amp;quot; temple burned before a silently reverent audience, taking with it our community's missives to the great beyond. All told, it was a very successful Burning Man event, however, trying to explain what Burning Man is to someone who has never been is a bit like trying to explain what a particular colour looks like to someone who is blind. For me this is the festival of all festivals. if you get the chance, go!'

<title>Scheme Boy - The Bass Boson</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//1578/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1578/</guid>
<description>The third member of London's Adverse Camber crew to contribute to Spannered's Radio section (alongside El Kano and Randomoidz), Scheme Boy delivers a steamroller of a mix that oscillates between mangled 'n' mentalist breaks and squashy pumping techno (with a cupful of fidgety funk thrown in for good measure).
&amp;nbsp;
Scheme Boy's music has recently appeared on&amp;nbsp;rambunctious record labels such as Bang-A-Rang and Ninja Columbo. When he's not scheming on his own he plays in acid 'n' break(core) duo Boep (with Randomoidz) and post-rock outfit Agent Elf. He also owns a striking collection of clothes pegs.
&amp;nbsp;

<title>Coppice - Vale of Health</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//1569/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1569/</guid>
<description>This is a welcoming mix, as satisfying as a warm mug of deep bass and crystalline sounds after a long day lolloping over the fields and through the trees of North London.  It opens and ends with classic Brian Eno tracks, extending over a broad sweep of ambience that takes in its path the breathy holds of Stars of the Lid and Coil's dense chemically inspired transcription.  Room is made for the inclusion of classic synth sounds from Vangelis, as well as the very modern artistry of Burial and attenuated swoops of COH.  So get out and enjoy some fresh air, then get cosy and listen to this one.
&amp;nbsp;
Coppice enjoys trees, air, and wild places, when not spending time in front of screens or speakers.
&amp;nbsp;
Tracklisting:


    Brian Eno - A Clearing
    Stars of the Lid - Apreludes (In C Sharp Major) 1
    COH - I Ascend Bright With Oxygen Mask
    Tangerine Dream - Mysterious Semblance at the Strand of Nightmares
    Vangelis - 100 Metres
    Bohren &amp;amp; Der Club of Gore - Midnight Black Earth
    Brian Eno - Aragon
    Ghislain Poirier - Complementaire De Bleu
    Radian - Tiefenscharfe
    Stars of the Lid - Articulate Silences Part 1:1
    Coil - Mexthoxy-N, N-Dimethyl (5-MeO-DMT)
    Autechre - Paralel Suns
    Abfahrt Hinwill - The Light
    Aphex Twin - Lichen
    Fennesz - Onsay
    Julee Cruise - Mysteries of Love
    Burial - Night Bus
    Christian Fennesz and Ryuichi Sakamoto - Aware
    Aphex Twin - Parallel Stripes

<title>DJ Wrongspeed - Bad Day for Owling Championships</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//1573/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1573/</guid>
<description>Last year we asked DJ Wrongspeed of Resonance FM's&amp;nbsp;tumultuous Red Zero Radio shows to put together a rowdy mix to blow away the winter cobwebs. He describes the resulting 21 minutes, Bad Day for Owling Championships, as 'a messed up hard drive all going wrong'; he also adds that some of the track names are better than the actual music... but we'll let you be the judge of that.
&amp;nbsp;
Paul Holmes shot the excellent abandoned surgery photo that accompanys the mix. You can check out more of his pictures here.
&amp;nbsp;

<itunes:subtitle>Resonance FM's DJ Wrongspeed presents the sound of a hard drive going wrong</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>Last year we asked DJ Wrongspeed of Resonance FM's&amp;nbsp;tumultuous Red Zero Radio shows to put together a rowdy mix to blow away the winter cobwebs. He describes the resulting 21 minutes, Bad Day for Owling Championships, as 'a messed up hard drive all going wrong'; he also adds that some of the track names are better than the actual music... but we'll let you be the judge of that.
&amp;nbsp;
Paul Holmes shot the excellent abandoned surgery photo that accompanys the mix. You can check out more of his pictures here.

<title>Joxaren - DJ Mix</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//1572/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1572/</guid>
<description>With a background in punk, dub, hip hop and electro, and over 500 live shows (under various guises) behind him, David Giese, aka Joxaren, has fine credentials as an ambassador for Scandinavia's burgeoning skweee movement.

Skweee, a style of stripped-down digital funk that draws influence from soul, R&amp;amp;B, electro and chiptune music, has been garnering kudos from blogs and forums through to the mainstream UK press over the past 12 months, helped in no small way by the first ever UK skweee showcase that took place at Ballers Social Club (LuckyMe's twice-monthly night in Glasgow) in January 2008.

Joxaren will be returning to Ballers Social Club later this month for one of his acclaimed live shows ('completely hardware based, improvised and energetic'), and to promote the gig he's put together this great DJ mix that juxtaposes pop and hip hop old and new with a slew of bumping skweee jams.
&amp;nbsp;
Keep a look out for Joxaren's limited 7&amp;quot; soon to drop on Frans Carlqvist's Flogsta Danshall imprint, and the forthcoming Skweee Tooth compilation (featuring his Fel i Facit track) on the excellent Ramp Recordings.
&amp;nbsp;
Tracklisting:
 


    Space - Velvet Rape
    Telepathe - Lights go Down
    The Cure - The Dream
    Eero Johannes - We could be Skweeeroes
    Rigas den Andre - Wedge (mash-up w/Spank Rock)
    Young Dro - Jackie Chan
    Limonious - Swedish Pommac (mash-up w/Chopper City Boys)
    Roots Manuva - Seat Yourself
    Melkeveien - Melkeveien
    Roots Manuva - Show must go on
    Uday - Ghetto Bomb
    Nitzer Ebb - Drive
    Depeche Mode - Fly on the Windscreen
    Boyz of Caligula - Izan Tiger
    Cat Stevens - Was Dog a Doughnut
    Teletron - What Time
    Mtume - I Simply Like
    EDMX - 100 (Uday Remix)
    Eden Hashish Center - Black Label Bootleg
    WET - Don't hide inside your Love
    Chocolate Star - The Pop
    Kleeer - Tonight

<description>This set of new material, originally broadcast at the end of 2008 on Scanone's Ill FM show, The Lost Tapes, is evidence of some seriously productive studio time since Point B made his debut contribution to Spannered just over a year ago. Not content with honing his dark dubstep/electro sound, Rich Bultitude has also been fleshing out two other projects from opposing ends of the rhythmic spectrum: Planes and Xammatu.
&amp;nbsp;
And if you haven't already grabbed it, there's a free EP of Point B tracks awaiting you over at his site...
&amp;nbsp;
Tracklisting:


    Creepy Steeple
    Someone Else's Past

<link>http://www.spannered.org//1443/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1443/</guid>
<description>In homage to the music he suckled on as a youth, badass beat junkie Bobby Corridor has put together this colossal hip hop megamix, shoeshorning an obscene 600+ tracks into 90 minutes.
&amp;nbsp;
In what he describes as 'a blip in the matrix', Mr Corridor has been nominated for best hip hop&amp;nbsp;DJ in this year's DJ Awards. If you'd like to help Bobby on his way to sipping a mojito around the pool as Cox and Tong lord it about in their g-strings, head over there and give your support! Alternatively, you can make yourself a mojito and check out Bobby's wicked Reggae Source mixtape that he recorded for Spannered in 2007.

<itunes:subtitle>Hip hop don't stop! Well, not for 600 tracks anyway. Master mixer Bobby Corridor returns to Spannered with the mother of all megamixes</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>In homage to the music he suckled on as a youth, badass beat junkie Bobby Corridor has put together this colossal hip hop megamix, shoeshorning an obscene 600+ tracks into 90 minutes.
&amp;nbsp;
In what he describes as 'a blip in the matrix', Mr Corridor has been nominated for best hip hop&amp;nbsp;DJ in this year's DJ Awards. If you'd like to help Bobby on his way to sipping a mojito around the pool as Cox and Tong lord it about in their g-strings, head over there and give your support! Alternatively, you can make yourself a mojito and check out Bobby's wicked Reggae Source mixtape that he recorded for Spannered in 2007.

Everybody in the house say hell yeah!

<link>http://www.spannered.org//1430/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1430/</guid>
<description>DubConscious is the alter ego for Bristol-based DJ Merkazoid, a young selector currently pushing the laptop reggae sound in the southwest of England. A convert from hip hop to bone-rattling Bristol bass and future dub, Mr Merkazoid tells us he's been busily knocking out six-hour reggae, ska and dub sets about the city. Stuffed to the hilt with tracks from Spannered faves such as Disrupt and Mungo's Hi Fi, this selection is pretty damn smokin', we reckon. Irie!

<itunes:subtitle>The second of two Bristol mixtapes to recently reach Spannered is a thoroughly enjoyable romp through reggae, ska and 8-bit territory</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>DubConscious is the alter ego for Bristol-based DJ Merkazoid, a young selector currently pushing the laptop reggae sound in the southwest of England. A convert from hip hop to bone-rattling Bristol bass and future dub, Mr Merkazoid tells us he's been busily knocking out six-hour reggae, ska and dub sets about the city. Stuffed to the hilt with tracks from Spannered faves such as Disrupt and Mungo's Hi Fi, this selection is pretty damn smokin', we reckon. Irie!

<title>Quarta330 - live at Back To Chill, Tokyo</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//1393/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1393/</guid>
<description>Japanese musician Quarta330, promoter of Tokyo's Lo-Bit Playground party, twisted plenty of heads on the dubstep scene last year with his immense 8-bit refix of Kode9's towering 9 Samurai track. He recently performed at Tokyo's Back To Chill night alongside other Japanese artists such as Goth Trad and T2R, armed with nothing more than two Game Boys, an interface and some effects pedals. Hosted both here and on Laurent Fintoni's blog, the set has a few jumpy levels and even a little technical down-time midway through; but don't let that put you off &amp;mdash; along with the essential styles currently blasting out of the Jahtari camp, this really is some of the heaviest, most off-the-hook 8-bit music out there at the moment.

No tracklisting.

<title>Combat Recordings - Mixed by Stormfield</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//1387/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1387/</guid>
<description>Since launching in 2004, Combat Recordings hasn't so much carved a niche in London&amp;#8217;s bass music scene as&amp;nbsp;hacked&amp;nbsp;a gaping hole in it with a heffing great katana. Oscillating between brooding breakbeats, brutalist electro and rough-edged 2-step/dubstep flavours, label releases have been dropping thick and fast from respected bass technicians such as Ardisson, Blackmass Plastics, Point B, Scanone and, most recently, the mighty Scorn.
&amp;nbsp;
Featuring highlights from the Combat back catalogue alongside unreleased goodies (such as&amp;nbsp;Threnody's dubplate-only remix of Unnatural Causes by Paradox &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;a track you'll never hear again in any other form), this mix was recorded late last year by label boss Stormfield. A shortened version of the mix recently featured on Rob Booth's excellent Electronic Explorations podcast series; the show has&amp;nbsp;served&amp;nbsp;up&amp;nbsp;a ton of great guest mixes from the likes of Surgeon, Milanese and Neil Landstrumm &amp;mdash; if you've not caught the series so far, head over there and get up to speed.
&amp;nbsp;

Tracklisting:


    Stormfield &amp;mdash; Intro (Sewer Scene)
    Komonazmuk &amp;amp; White Boi &amp;mdash; Apocalypse
    Cursor Miner &amp;mdash; Carnivore (Milanese remix)
    Stormfield &amp;mdash; Interlude (Gutter Ambush)
    Stormfield &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;Inner Silence, Outer Violence

<title>The Heatwave - Rowdy Bashment 2007</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//1365/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1365/</guid>
<description>Jamaican producers may be pressing less and less vinyl but the island still churned out around two thousand 7&amp;quot; singles last year and these are our favourite rowdy ones. In the words of a Heatwave regular who got a sneak preview of the mix:

&amp;quot;Who am I? The dancehall king&amp;quot;

A look back at 2007 enables you to go from the filthy, nasty but undeniably inspirational sex talk of Beenie Man, Chamelion and 'Sweet' C to the sparse vocal angriness of that old Elephant bloke and then surrender to the leg-lifting power of the Matterhorn man. And you're just getting started.

&amp;quot;Everybody start tek way yourself. Follow the riddim and tek way yourself&amp;quot;

What jumps out when you listen to these tracks all together is the control each artist commands. You feel at their mercy, and they're merciless. Whether it's the riddims coming in that you know you know - but you don't know you know until you hear the drop, and then you're shaking your shit so hard you're not sure what you know any more - or the fierceness of the lyrics that are flying at you like you're in a video game and you can't move quick enough so you just start letting them hit you. Just. Let. Go.

&amp;quot;Have you heard about that little boy in Jamaica?&amp;quot;

Militaristic beats dropping left, right and centre make you feel like you're a kind of bashment brigadier going over the top of the trench. It's weird when you've hated so much of what Shaggy has put out in the past to hear him rip the arsehole out of the Heathen riddim. I thought there were no lyrics that could excuse Angel.

&amp;quot;Return of the Indian. Truths and rights weh we come to tell the nation&amp;quot;

Like most years, 2007 leaves you with the perplexing problem of Sean Paul. It basically comes down to the fact that your legs and hips and arse have more respect for his voice than your brain. It's a bit like when Elephant Man provides the sting in the tail of the whole mix with Three Step on the Madness riddim. You'd like to sit down and have a rest, drink a cup of tea or maybe work on your New Year's resolutions, but it all just has you reaching for the rewind button yet again.

Tracklisting:

    Beenie Man &amp;mdash; Mi Nuh See It (Voiceful &amp;mdash; Black Jack riddim)
    Chamelion &amp;mdash; She Nah Answa (Voiceful &amp;mdash; Black Jack riddim)

    Elephant Man &amp;mdash; Stamina (Studio 2000 &amp;mdash; Bug Out riddim)
    Vybz Kartel &amp;mdash; Translator (Black Pearl &amp;mdash; Pearl Haaba riddim)

    Danny English &amp;mdash; The Way You Move (Kirkledove &amp;mdash; Dutch Pat riddim)

<itunes:summary>Jamaican producers may be pressing less and less vinyl but the island still churned out around two thousand 7&amp;quot; singles last year and these are our favourite rowdy ones. In the words of a Heatwave regular who got a sneak preview of the mix:

&amp;quot;Who am I? The dancehall king&amp;quot;

A look back at 2007 enables you to go from the filthy, nasty but undeniably inspirational sex talk of Beenie Man, Chamelion and 'Sweet' C to the sparse vocal angriness of that old Elephant bloke and then surrender to the leg-lifting power of the Matterhorn man. And you're just getting started.

&amp;quot;Everybody start tek way yourself. Follow the riddim and tek way yourself&amp;quot;

What jumps out when you listen to these tracks all together is the control each artist commands. You feel at their mercy, and they're merciless. Whether it's the riddims coming in that you know you know - but you don't know you know until you hear the drop, and then you're shaking your shit so hard you're not sure what you know any more - or the fierceness of the lyrics that are flying at you like you're in a video game and you can't move quick enough so you just start letting them hit you. Just. Let. Go.

&amp;quot;Have you heard about that little boy in Jamaica?&amp;quot;

Militaristic beats dropping left, right and centre make you feel like you're a kind of bashment brigadier going over the top of the trench. It's weird when you've hated so much of what Shaggy has put out in the past to hear him rip the arsehole out of the Heathen riddim. I thought there were no lyrics that could excuse Angel.

&amp;quot;Return of the Indian. Truths and rights weh we come to tell the nation&amp;quot;

Like most years, 2007 leaves you with the perplexing problem of Sean Paul. It basically comes down to the fact that your legs and hips and arse have more respect for his voice than your brain. It's a bit like when Elephant Man provides the sting in the tail of the whole mix with Three Step on the Madness riddim. You'd like to sit down and have a rest, drink a cup of tea or maybe work on your New Year's resolutions, but it all just has you reaching for the rewind button yet again.

<link>http://www.spannered.org//1357/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1357/</guid>
<description>Chris Wood from the goodie-packed Word the Cat blog recently dropped us a line about the splendid new mix he's concocted. It brought to mind Hanuman's and El Kano's playlists (two of our fave DJs here at Spannered) &amp;mdash; a slew of moods from the grime and dubstep worlds, liberally sprinkled with flavas stretching from bassline house, bumpy ragga and old skool to 8-bit dub, Nepali lok pop, frosty minimalism and chiptune breakcore; he's even managed to slide in a few words of hillwalking wisdom from the late, great Alfred Wainwright.
&amp;nbsp;
Chris has kindly let us host the mix here in Spannered's radio archive. He asked it we'd link listeners up to the 8bitcollective site &amp;mdash; 'the first completely open chiptune-related media repository and file sharing community'. The electronicMESS track is available there for use under a Creative Commons License, along with a stack of other great 8-bit jams. Go check it.

<title>Point B - on Sub FM</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//1332/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1332/</guid>
<description>
If you're not familiar with the sound of London's Combat Recordings, this recent live set from label artist Point B should serve as a fine introduction &amp;mdash; a 24-minute blowout of dubby, grimey electronica and plucky 2-step flavours, featuring unreleased tunes alongside two tracks from his latest Combat EP.
&amp;nbsp;
Richard  Bultitude's music has also found its way onto SCSI AV, Erratica, Colony Productions and Orson Records. This live mix was recorded for Boomnoise and Pokes' Sub FM show. Sub FM is an excellent web radio station, whose archive features an absurd amount of shows spanning grime, breaks, dub, dubstep and garage &amp;mdash; go check it out...
&amp;nbsp;
You can catch Point B next playing on the 22 December, in London, when Combat Recordings teams up with local filth merchants Plex and Yardcore for a Christmas knees-up at the A10 Bar on Kingsland Road (complete with mistletoe and grime, and poledancing in the basement). More info here.
&amp;nbsp;
Tracklisting:


    Point B &amp;mdash; Cornered
    Point B &amp;mdash; Gymede (Combat Recordings)
    Point B &amp;mdash; Saw Dust
    Point B &amp;mdash; Angular Rounded
    Point B &amp;mdash; Out Side In
    Point B &amp;mdash; Embryonic (Combat Recordings)

^ Cinder Cones and Animal Bones is out now on Combat Recordings

<title>Camilo Rocha - Disco Demolition Derby</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//1311/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1311/</guid>
<description> 
Back in the peak of the &amp;ldquo;disco sucks&amp;rdquo; movement, Ted Nugent-adoring redneck crowds would promote &amp;ldquo;disco demolition derbys&amp;rdquo;, where they would proceed to torch piles of disco records. They were expressing their hatred of a music that was: a) pansexual; b) of black, Latin and gay origins; c) produced by studio boffins; d) exuded cosmopolitan savoir faire.

Disco was, then, also &amp;lsquo;dying&amp;#8217; in the mainstream, thanks to an onslaught of extremely cheesy tunes that clogged the airwaves. Unfortunately, to a lot of people this is the disco they know: Village People-style crap, bad karaoke fodder.

Disco, of course, was so much more than that. It not only carried on breathing, thanks to a creative and thriving underground, but also became the blueprint for the next dancefloor revolution just round the corner &amp;mdash; namely house music. To this day, it remains one of the key influences in the music many of us dance to.

This podcast pays tribute to this magnificent movement by &amp;lsquo;demolishing&amp;#8217; disco in a much more positive way: mixing, editing, juxtaposing and mashing up new and old interpretations. From the galactic bliss of Orlando Riva Sound to the symphonic sass of the Salsoul Orchestra, from the synthetic homages of Lindstrom &amp;amp; Prins Thomas to the shiny funkiness of Le Grand David, from the leftfield proto-garage of Loose Joints to the classic italo sounds of Klein &amp;amp; MBO, there is a bit of everything in here. You'll also hear Chicken Lips, Giorgio Moroder, Jermaine Jackson, Donna Summer, Dinosaur, Padded Cell and, erm, The Glitter Band (funky as fuck, check it out!).

Brazilians make two decisive contributions: Azymuth's anthemic Jazz Carnival and Jorge Ben's discofied samba Taj Mahal (which Rod Stewart stole for Do Ya Think I'm Sexy &amp;mdash; Ben sued and won, you'll be pleased to know).

Before you ask, this mix was done in Ableton Live, so those ever-shifting live drummer beats from the 1970s would behave and sit where they were told.

<itunes:subtitle>Brazilian DJ and journalist Camilo Rocha proves he's got bigger disco balls than most with this deep exploration of the style from 1972 to present day</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary> 
Back in the peak of the &amp;ldquo;disco sucks&amp;rdquo; movement, Ted Nugent-adoring redneck crowds would promote &amp;ldquo;disco demolition derbys&amp;rdquo;, where they would proceed to torch piles of disco records. They were expressing their hatred of a music that was: a) pansexual; b) of black, Latin and gay origins; c) produced by studio boffins; d) exuded cosmopolitan savoir faire.

Disco was, then, also &amp;lsquo;dying&amp;#8217; in the mainstream, thanks to an onslaught of extremely cheesy tunes that clogged the airwaves. Unfortunately, to a lot of people this is the disco they know: Village People-style crap, bad karaoke fodder.

Disco, of course, was so much more than that. It not only carried on breathing, thanks to a creative and thriving underground, but also became the blueprint for the next dancefloor revolution just round the corner &amp;mdash; namely house music. To this day, it remains one of the key influences in the music many of us dance to.

This podcast pays tribute to this magnificent movement by &amp;lsquo;demolishing&amp;#8217; disco in a much more positive way: mixing, editing, juxtaposing and mashing up new and old interpretations. From the galactic bliss of Orlando Riva Sound to the symphonic sass of the Salsoul Orchestra, from the synthetic homages of Lindstrom &amp;amp; Prins Thomas to the shiny funkiness of Le Grand David, from the leftfield proto-garage of Loose Joints to the classic italo sounds of Klein &amp;amp; MBO, there is a bit of everything in here. You'll also hear Chicken Lips, Giorgio Moroder, Jermaine Jackson, Donna Summer, Dinosaur, Padded Cell and, erm, The Glitter Band (funky as fuck, check it out!).

Brazilians make two decisive contributions: Azymuth's anthemic Jazz Carnival and Jorge Ben's discofied samba Taj Mahal (which Rod Stewart stole for Do Ya Think I'm Sexy &amp;mdash; Ben sued and won, you'll be pleased to know).

Before you ask, this mix was done in Ableton Live, so those ever-shifting live drummer beats from the 1970s would behave and sit where they were told.

<title>Bobby Corridor - Reggae Source</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//1310/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1310/</guid>
<description>Bobby cut his teeth in the big bad hip hop scene of Cambridge, before moving on to provide the scratches for Earthling where Geoff Barrow left off. More recently he's been vomiting mixes onto the internet at an astonishing rate, covering as many musical bases as humanely possible.
&amp;nbsp;
Despite having an unhealthy obsession with rappers whose names begin in &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo;, Bobby is probably best known for Melancholy Flowers, the big girl's blouse of the mix world, but has also made mixes for Solid Steel, the Cactus Island label, and (mainly) his own head.
&amp;nbsp;
In this, his latest mix, he revisits some classic dancehall and lays it on a crispy bed of hip hop, drum 'n' bass and dubstep. And some Schoolly D.

<title>Dub Boy - Oct 2007 Reggae/Dancehall Mix</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//1272/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1272/</guid>
<description>Bristol and bass music have been happy bedfellows for a long, long time, but in recent years a new wave of producers, promoters and DJs have been properly shaking up the city's clubs, pubs, bars and warehouses, throwing traditional dub, reggae and dancehall flavours into the hotpot alongside dubstep, grime, ragga, breakcore and jungle &amp;mdash; crews such as P.R.A.N.K., Dissident, Heatwave and Hench, and events such as Subloaded, Dubloaded, Toxic Dancehall and Ruffnek Diskotek, to name a few.

Dub Boy, aka Tim Rayner, is one of the driving forces behind Ruffnek Diskotek &amp;mdash; a regular fixture about town that sticks doggedly to its mantra of supplying 'riddim and bass to wind up yuh waist', roping in many of the scene's biggest names and all the best local acts to ensure the job gets done properly. Tim's quite a selector, having played alongside luminaries ranging from David Rodigan and Digital Mystikz to Klute and Congo Natty. He recently sent over this brand new 38-track reggae and dancehall mix to Spannered, which we're sure you'll agree is an absolute stonker.

^ The next Ruffnek Discotek takes place at The Croft, Bristol on Friday 2 November, with guests including Benga (Big Apple), Rossi B and Toddla T.

<itunes:subtitle>Spannered's second mix of gruff bassline electronics from the boy El Kano</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>Hold a chicken in the air, stick a deckchair up your nose and crank your amp to eleven &amp;mdash; because we've another white-hot selection for you from the one and only El Kano of London's Adverse Camber collective. This man's DJ mixes are always bang on point, and this delightful spread of grimey electronica and twitchy dubstep is no exception. If you missed the mix he recorded specially for the site last year, head here and fill your lugholes &amp;mdash; and should you be in need of more, drag your arse over to his page on the Adverse Camber site.
&amp;nbsp;
Being a bit of a Photoshop wizard, he's concocted some cool artwork for the mix too. Enjoy!

<description>South London-based Kim Sampson, aka Skim, has been crafting some great DJ mixes over the last few years, so we figured it was high time we asked her to put one together for Spannered. Her genre-hopping DJing makes for a curious mixture of sounds, best demonstrated on her radio shows for Resonance FM (Burning Decks and Decibel Breach) and Ill FM.

    Machine Drum &amp;mdash; Urban Biology (Merck)
    No Movement No Sound No Memories &amp;mdash; Acetate (Lux Nigra)

    ScanOne &amp;mdash; Cutters Choice (Combat)
    2562 &amp;mdash; Circulate (Tectonic)

<title>Neil Landstrumm - Subs &amp; Steel Mix</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//1257/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1257/</guid>
<description>Scottish techno pioneer, Spannered associate and owner of one very fine hat, Neil Landstrumm last graced these pages when the site launched back in December 2006. Well, he's back with a splendid new live recording, put together in Edinburgh this month as a promo for his current Subs &amp;amp; Steel tour. The string of dates kicked off at the Today's Art festival last weekend, where he also performed for the first time with collaborator Milanese.
&amp;nbsp;
On more of a broken tip than his previous studio mixes, the sound is still unmistakably Landstrumm, with all manner of spannered electronic rhythms freaking out under a storm of bleeps, bass and thick Jupiter 8 stabs.
&amp;nbsp;
For current tour dates, check his MurdochSpace page.

<link>http://www.spannered.org//1255/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1255/</guid>
<description>For some years now, Bristol's under_score crew have been flying the flag for deep techno flavours in the city, putting on parties with guests such as Sleeparchive, Claro Intelecto and Errorsmith, and showing plenty of love too for the dubstep/techno crossover currently blossoming (Bristol pioneer Pinch performed at under_score alongside Manchester's Andy Stott earlier this year).
&amp;nbsp;
High quality guests aside, under_score's position on the local scene has been firmly cemented by way of core residents Microman (aka one half of Emptyset), Luke Malcher and  Jim Petherwick &amp;mdash; and Jim has kindly put together this exclusive mix for Spannered, which gives an excellent introduction to the under_score sound.
&amp;nbsp;
Tracklisting:


    Tony Allen &amp;mdash; Ole (Moritz von Oswald remix)
    Claude Vonstroke &amp;mdash; Who's Afraid of Detroit? (Deepchord Remix)
    Model 500 &amp;mdash; Starlight
    Luciano &amp;mdash; Fourges et Sabres
    Maurizio &amp;mdash; Domina
    Substance &amp;amp; Vainqueur &amp;mdash; Immersion (Sleeparchive Remix)
    Sleeparchive &amp;mdash; Research
    Henry &amp;amp; Louis &amp;mdash; Answer (DJ Pinch Remix)
    Lowtec &amp;mdash; Workshop 1 side A (untitled)
    Baby Ford &amp;amp; Zip &amp;mdash; No Milk Today
    T++ &amp;mdash; Space Break
    2562 &amp;mdash; Circulate
    Rhythm &amp;amp; Sound &amp;mdash; Poor People Must Work (Carl Craig Remix)
    Heartthrob &amp;mdash; Gollum
    Rhythm &amp;amp; Sound w/ Shalom &amp;mdash; We Been Troddin

&amp;nbsp;
^ You can catch the under_score crew in action at the Blue Mountain Club, Bristol, on 22 September, with Baby Ford and Raudive (aka Oliver Ho) headlining.

<title>Goth Trad - live on Resonance FM</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//1253/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1253/</guid>
<description>Few Japanese music producers are pushing the envelope as much as Takeaki Maruyama aka Goth Trad. An avid collector of vinyl and CDs since his early years, Takeaki has been making electronic music since the age of 19, releasing on prestigious labels in his own country and, more recently, on UK-based dubstep imprints. Indeed, the current incarnation of his sound has found great affinity with the fast-growing global dubstep audience &amp;mdash; and his place within the scene's higher ranks is set to be cemented this coming weekend when he becomes the first artist to perform live (ie a non-vinyl set) at the legendary DMZ night in Brixton, London.
&amp;nbsp;
To accompany Laurent Fintoni's lengthy interview with Goth Trad, we're chuffed as chips to host this blistering live set, recorded on Resonance FM on 21 September 2006 for the station's Clear Spot show.</description>

<description>When it comes to digging up lost Brazilian classics, Paulo Sakae Tahira is something of an archaeologist. A full-time researcher of m&amp;uacute;sica brasileira from the second half of the 20th century, Paul&amp;atilde;o (that's 'Big Paul', to non-Portuguese speakers) isn't, thankfully, the kind of vinyl addict who keeps his prized finds hidden away under lock and key; his DJ performances have taken him all over Brazil, and as far afield as France, Spain and Switzerland.

Hailing from the concrete jungle of S&amp;atilde;o Paulo, Paul&amp;atilde;o moved to the nearby city of Campinas in the early nineties, where he developed both his skills as a DJ and his reputation as a discerning connoisseur of his country's music (with particular focus to the 60s and 70s). There he helped to establish R&amp;aacute;dio Muda, a terrestrial radio project to which he still contributes. Together with friends, he was responsible for bringing big name acts to Campinas during the nineties with a series of seminal parties, Festas Black. In the years since, Paul&amp;atilde;o has been involved in promoting various other events, and has played alongside many of the country's best-known artists. He also writes for the excellent Brazilian music site Gafieiras.

Now based back in S&amp;atilde;o Paulo, Paul&amp;atilde;o is currently finalising details of his second European tour (you can find out where and when to catch him by visiting his site). His scope as a record selector extends far beyond the shores of Brazil, to Afrobeat, New Orleans jazz and various other strains of Black music and rare groove, but if you want a taste of real deal Brazilian hot stuff, check this out...

<title>Disrupt - Live at Glasgow Art School</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//1234/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1234/</guid>
<description>Jan Gleichmar, aka Disrupt, and partner in crime Rootah are leading the way in laptop dub reggae with their mighty fine web label Jahtari. Operated out of Jan's flat in Leipzig, Germany, the Jahtari site is a goldmine of free music from Jan and fellow subscribers to the label's theory. There's tons of cool writing too, about reggae history, the Commodore 64, old bits of music kit... and plenty more besides.
&amp;nbsp;
In anticipation of Spannered's forthcoming interview with Jan, we suggest you fill your ears with this hour-long Disrupt set, recorded live in Glasgow on 31 March of this year, when he played for the city's Mungo's Hi Fi crew. And remember, Spannered is hosting a great studio mix from the Mungo's guys too, chock full of goodies from their Scotch Bonnet imprint.

<title>Mungo's Hi Fi - Scotch Bonnet Mix</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//1224/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1224/</guid>
<description>Since 2002, Mungo's Hi Fi Soundsystem have been showing big love for all things reggae, dub, ska and dancehall by releasing some seriously high-grade music &amp;mdash; not to mention regularly shaking Glasgow's foundations with their lofty speaker stacks.
&amp;nbsp;
Following three outings on London's Dubhead label, the lads decided to set up their own imprint in 2005 &amp;mdash; the wonderfully titled Scotch Bonnet Records. There's been a slew of 7&amp;quot;s and 10&amp;quot;s so far, all as hot as the label name suggests, with their unstoppable Belly Ska Riddim blazing its way across the UK, America, Germany and Poland. And there's no let up in pressure; next month sees their huge Mary Jane Riddim unleashed on a series of singles that feature vocals from Top Cat, Carl Meeks, Kenny Knots, Mikey Murka, Soom T and El Fata. There's also a Mungo's Hi Fi album on the way, due out on Scotch Bonnet in the not-to-distant future. In fact, they tell us they're sitting on so much new material that they don't know what to do with it all!
&amp;nbsp;
For those unable to catch Mungo's Hi Fi on their European travels in the coming months, they've kindly supplied Spannered with this killer studio mix, packed full of unreleased Scotch Bonnet goodness. As you can tell, they've been feeling the current dubstep flavours too &amp;mdash; hold tight for releases later in the year!

<title>DJ Rupture - Resonance FM Post Election Special</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//553/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//553/</guid>
<description>DJ /rupture came up with a swiftly executed and devastatingly effective musical counterstrike against the re-election of the world's least favourite leader in 2004. Previously hosted on Musicalbear, the mix combines more commercial US productions (opening with Baby Boy and finding room for Terror Squad's anthemic Lean Back) with the usual /rupture mash-up of breakcore, gabba, jungle and general intense, nose-bleeding noise. As a gesture to US Army interrogation techniques, someone really ought to shut George Bush in a steel container and play this to him at full volume until his head explodes or he experiences a sudden conversion to grime and breakcore. A crazed scream interrupts the most laid-back, downtempo part of the mix: don't relax or the Republicans might get away with even more than they already have.

The breakbeats are interspersed with evocative classics  (like the Honeydrippers Impeach The President) and snatches of lyrics &amp;ndash; 'I'm not your typical American' intones one MC, just before the music breaks down into distortion and frantic hardcore. Perhaps the most heartening thing for the UK listener is the number of British productions and MCs involved in the mix. Highlights from the UK side of the pond include the Bizzle's Forward Riddim (someone should bring the arms house to George Bush's mum's house), Lady Sovereign doing her excellent 'Ch Ching' thing and the crazy Deathsucker release Murder Dem which twists a dancehall version of Israelites into manic ragga jungle. Jamaican sounds are well represented with /rupture's own Sister Nancy collaboration Little More Oil coming through strongly, and there's also room for the all-time reggae classic, Willie Williams Armagideon Time. We hope the apocalypse isn't really imminent but, in the circumstances, it's a fair point &amp;ndash; the battle is getting hotter and a lot of people won't get no justice tonight.
&amp;nbsp;

<title>Gabriel Heatwave - Musical Bare Dancehall Mix Part 2</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//585/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//585/</guid>
<description>Gabriel's December 2004 Musical Bare Dancehall Mix was downloaded thousands of times from the Musicalbear site. Twelve months on the DJ from the Heatwave collective returned with another selection of some of the hottest dancehall tunes around at the time.

The mix opens with a few of Gabriel's own blends on the massive, funked-up Doosra riddim, a production from Manchester's Spybase. The instrumental is blended with some classic 90s ragga vocals and a single from Ms Thing, plus the acapella from Sunshine, the first release on Heatwave&amp;#8217;s own label, Scandal Bag.

Following on are extended version excursions on one of the latest Dave Kelly productions, Bad Gal and the Coolie Dance-esque Kopa riddim. Other featured rhythms include the squelchy, electro sounds of Phantom and Strip Tease, the dark 'n' dirty Dancehall Rock and the decidedly non-dancehall funk of Money Juggling, plus a bit of soca niceness, sizzling ska from Sizzla and a Heatwave remix on the collective's own bootleg label, Punchline.
&amp;nbsp;
Mixed by Gabriel on two Technics 1210s &amp;amp; a Numark mixer
Mastered by Daddy Henry @ Dub Studio, Bristol
Intro by Quality Diamond

<title>Soundmurderer - at Bashout, Bristol</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//1154/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1154/</guid>
<description>Hailing from Detroit, Michigan, Todd Osborn aka Soundmurderer has gained a reputation as one of most exciting junglists to emerge from the US. Owner of the sought-after Rewind Records imprint, Todd set up the first ever drum 'n' bass store in Detroit, Dubplate Pressure. He was finally given the props he deserves through his colossal Wired For Sound mix CD, released on Tigerbeat6 sub-label Violent Turd in 2003, and has spent recent years dropping ballistic ragga-charged jungle sets from his laptop to crowds pretty much all over the place. Anyone following his musical trajectory will also know of his acid, house, booty, Detroit techno and experimental works on labels such as Spectral, Throw, TNT, Databass and ~scape.

This set was recorded at Bashout in Bristol on 9 December 2006, when Soundmurderer played alongside DJ Hidden, Parasite and a host of other acts. Rising from the ashes of Bristol's mentalist Toxic Dancehall jams, Bashout dishes out a thunderous dose of bottom end therapy every few months at the city's legendary Black Swan venue. For details of forthcoming parties, visit their website.

<itunes:subtitle>Todd Osborn slips into his jungle pyjamas to perform at Bristol's Bashout night under his Soundmurderer guise</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>Hailing from Detroit, Michigan, Todd Osborn aka Soundmurderer has gained a reputation as one of most exciting junglists to emerge from the US. Owner of the sought-after Rewind Records imprint, Todd set up the first ever drum 'n' bass store in Detroit, Dubplate Pressure. He was finally given the props he deserves through his colossal Wired For Sound mix CD, released on Tigerbeat6 sub-label Violent Turd in 2003, and has spent recent years dropping ballistic ragga-charged jungle sets from his laptop to crowds pretty much all over the place. Anyone following his musical trajectory will also know of his acid, house, booty, Detroit techno and experimental works on labels such as Spectral, Throw, TNT, Databass and ~scape.

This set was recorded at Bashout in Bristol on 9 December 2006, when Soundmurderer played alongside DJ Hidden, Parasite and a host of other acts. Rising from the ashes of Bristol's mentalist Toxic Dancehall jams, Bashout dishes out a thunderous dose of bottom end therapy every few months at the city's legendary Black Swan venue.

<title>Marolo - Noise Retrospective 1913-2007</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//1152/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1152/</guid>
<description>&amp;quot;In 1913 Futurist Luigi Russolo developed several noise machines, which he named &amp;lsquo;intonarumori&amp;#8217;. In his manifesto, The Art of Noise, Russolo argued that musical instruments could no longer satisfy man's thirst for sounds. Almost 100 years later, people are still exploring the possibilities of sound. This is what I tried to capture in this mix - testing the limits of sound, from shrieking highs to almost imperceptible lows, finding new ways of interpreting and portraying life through the medium of sound. Despite including over 100 artists, the mix by no means represents a completist viewpoint; so many perhaps important artists in the development of 'noise' were left out. It was not my intention to do a 'who's who' of noise music, but rather to show how the exploration of sound has developed over time and how fascinating these explorations are. I did at times take into account the historical significance of the piece/artist when choosing tracks, although I was steered mainly by what was sonically interesting to me. Well that's it - the mix should speak for itself. If you are interested in digging deeper please follow the links provided. Listen at maximum volume and enjoy.&amp;quot;

<title>Aaron Spectre - at Mega Bass Robo Orgy</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//1127/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1127/</guid>
<description>Berlin resident Aaron Spectre mashes up the place. Fact. Propelled along by a junglistic undercurrent, his sets have become something of legend, drawing on grime, hip hop, dubstep, ragga, punk, thrash metal and ear-pummelling breakcore. If this floats your boat, we recommend you check his excellent productions on Death$ucker and Omeko.

This set was recorded at the Mega Bass Robo Orgy in London, June 2005.

<title>El Kano - Spannered Mix</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//1103/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//1103/</guid>
<description>El Kano is the graphic design lynchpin of the Adverse Camber collective, a motley bunch of South London dwellers who, despite putting on events with scary names such as 'The Night of Awesome Power', will always take the time to make you a nice cup of tea (though you may have to nip down the shop to get biscuits). He used to be called Kano, but couldn't be bothered beefing with the numerous other Kanos laying claim to the name, so now he's El Kano, which is cooler anyway.

His DJ mixes are consistently badass, and he's put this one together especially for Spannered.

Tracklisting:

    Spac Hand Luke &amp;ndash; Dynocock (Rephlex)
    Ghislain Poirier &amp;amp; Mr Lee G &amp;ndash; Dem Nah Like Me (Remix) (Shockout)
    Andy Page &amp;ndash; Bisted &amp;amp; Twitter (Noodles Institute of Technology)
    Milanese &amp;ndash; Caramel Cognac (Planet Mu)
    Mr Oizo &amp;ndash; Inside The Kidney Machine (Family Affair)
    F&amp;uuml;nkst&amp;ouml;rung &amp;ndash; Punk Motherfucker (Studio !K7)
    Neil Landstrumm &amp;ndash; Master Assasin (Seed Records)
    Pope Thermador &amp;ndash; Selassie on the Wye (Unreleased)
    Menta feat. Ms Dynamite &amp;ndash; Ramp (Bigger Beats)
    Drop the Lime &amp;ndash; Hold On (Rag &amp;amp; Bone)
    Bass Clef &amp;ndash; Life's Great... In E8 (Blank Tapes)
    DJ C feat. Lady Saw &amp;ndash; Jump Up &amp;amp; Bounce (Unreleased)
    Timeblind &amp;ndash; Fleshwound (Soot)
    El-B feat. Juiceman &amp;ndash; Buck &amp;amp; Bury (Tempa)
    Boxcutter &amp;ndash; Hyloz (Planet Mu)
    Stormfield &amp;ndash; Haiku (Monkeysteak Remix) (Forthcoming on Combat)
    The Bug feat. Flowdan &amp;ndash; Jah War (Planet Mu)
    Muslimgauze &amp;ndash; Fall of Granada (Staalplaat)
    DJ Food &amp;ndash; Monocle (Silver Dub) (Ninja Tune)
    Digital Mystikz &amp;ndash; Ancient Memories (Skream Remix) (DMZ)
    Mathhead &amp;ndash; Stagger Dub (Unreleased)

<title>Filastine - Live at Gramaphone, London</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//854/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.spannered.org//854/</guid>
<description>Filastine released his debut LP Burn It on DJ /rupture's Soot Records imprint earlier this year. The album showcases his skill as percussionist and vision as a producer, combining a globe-trotting sensibility with deft programming. Arabic, Brazilian and other traditions meet crunching street beats to create an album that is widely travelled but still rooted in a carefully crafted individual aesthetic. This mix showcases Filastine's live show, which has a rowdy edge not so audible on his studio work. The same striking fragments of recorded sounds heard on the record are combined with dubstep, breakcore, grime, dancehall and loops and acapellas from other cutting edge club sounds. Add the spice of live percussion, played on a darbouka, midi drums, and a shopping trolley, and you have the recipe for something very tasty indeed.

The Gramaphone session was recorded at a Soot Records party in London which was held for the launch of Filastine's album in June 2006. DJ /rupture, Heatwave and Uberdog also played and the enthusiastic crowd can be heard at the beginning and the end.

No tracklisting.

<title>Doc Brown and Yungun - Mad World Remix</title>
<link>http://www.spannered.org//271/</link>

<description>UK MC Doc Brown here trades in the whimsical universality of the Tears For Fears lyrics for a stark but affecting account of why exactly his world is going crazy and adds a lilting hip hop beat to the catchy piano hook of the original. A coherent social consciousness &amp;ndash; he alludes to 'the tramp with his change cup' &amp;ndash; underpins the fierce brutalism of his account of why we're going nowhere: 'It's a disgrace / this place is like a whorehouse / the crooked system's the pimp / that's got us working till we're worn out'. An unnamed collaborator comes in on the second verse to give an account of his education which is so much more detailed and evocative than the original's assertion that 'I was very nervous / no one knew me'. Doc Brown's idea that insanity is to do with being 'a rat trapped in the system / of capitalism' is compelling and his powerful delivery contrasts perfectly with Gary Jules' ethereal vocal. This version deserves to displace the original in the public consciousness &amp;ndash; it would be a mad world if it didn't.</description>
